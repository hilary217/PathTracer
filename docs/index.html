        <p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.</p>
        <o>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both mesh images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p> 
        <p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
            <p>describe what you did in part 1.</p>
            <p>Answer: In part 1, reflection and refraction are implemented and can be visualized via two spheres in the box. Increasing the maximum ray depth increases the maximum number of times a ray can be reflected and refracted. They are a little bit noisy because of the low sample rate.</p>

            <p>Show a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light. Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.</p>

            <p>Answer:</p>

    <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
